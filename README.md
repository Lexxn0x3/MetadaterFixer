# MetaFixer

## Description
MetaFixer is a versatile Python utility designed to correct and standardize metadata for files downloaded from various messaging and social media platforms, such as Telegram. When files are shared or downloaded through these platforms, their original creation dates and times can be lost or misrepresented, leading to issues with organization and archival. MetaFixer addresses this problem by analyzing filenames that often contain embedded date and time information or Unix timestamps, extracting this information, and then updating the files' metadata accordingly.

This utility supports a range of common file types, including JPEG images and MP4 videos, making it particularly useful for managing media files that are frequently exchanged over messaging apps. By extracting date and time data directly from filenames — which can include human-readable dates, Unix timestamps, or other encoded forms — MetaFixer restores accurate creation dates within the files' metadata. This process not only aids in better file management and organization but also preserves the original context in which the files were created or shared.

### Key Features
- Supports JPEG and MP4 file formats, commonly used in messaging apps.
- Capable of parsing both human-readable date formats and Unix timestamps from filenames.
- Updates file system metadata to reflect the correct creation date and time, enhancing file organization.
- User-friendly and adaptable, designed for both casual users and digital archivists.

MetaFixer is an indispensable tool for anyone looking to maintain an accurate and organized digital media library, especially when dealing with files downloaded from messaging platforms where metadata integrity is often compromised.
